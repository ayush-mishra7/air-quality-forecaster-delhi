# About This Project

This project demonstrates a complete, end-to-end machine learning workflow for time-series forecasting, using the prediction of PM2.5 air quality in Delhi as a case study. The pipeline covers every critical stage, from data acquisition and cleaning to exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and the training and evaluation of two different types of models: a classic Random Forest and a deep learning-based LSTM network.

Important Note on the Dataset: This entire project was developed using a very small, sample toy dataset containing only a few hours of data. The primary goal was to build and demonstrate the complete pipeline rather than achieve high predictive accuracy.

Consequently, the graphical representations of the model predictions will not reflect real-world performance. The models, especially the LSTM, have done their best to learn from extremely limited information, resulting in simplified or flat prediction lines. This is an expected outcome and highlights the importance of comprehensive data in any real-world machine learning task. The value of this repository lies in the code structure and the step-by-step process, not in the predictive power of the final models.
